      There is not a lot I want to say about myself.  I care about my family, skiing, hiking, biking,
      reading and enjoy using computers and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally I enjoy solving technical problems and endeavor to manage project in a disciplined manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I prefer to talk more about this website.
